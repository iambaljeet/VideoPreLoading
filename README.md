# VideoPreLoading
Demo for video PreLoading/ PreCaching using ExoPlayer 2.13.3 in Android.

With this project we used some dome videos URL's and Adnroid intent service to preload/precache those videos in background.
If a video is found cached the player will use local cache to play those videos otherwise will load it from server.
